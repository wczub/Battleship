# Battleship
## What is it
This is a text based version of the classic game Battleship. The program will only be playable with singleplayer. This is to allow the development of a more advanced computer opponent. 
## Purpose
This project is to allow myself to create an AI opponent to play battleship against. The goal is to create an interatively more comprehensive AI. This means that it's going to start with a simple AI that just guesses randomly wherever it wants to. Then i will keep making it more and more comprehensive until it uses statistical information on where the user is most likely to place their ships and where they are most likely to guess.
