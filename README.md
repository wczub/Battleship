# Battleship
## What is it
This is a text based version of the classic game Battleship. 
The master branch should always hold a working version of the game.
Or at least the most bug free. The computer branch is where a lot of future changes will take place.
Using the files "fire" and "hit", the computer will increment the locations of where the user fires, and where it finds the user.

## Purpose
This is just a pet project of mine to have fun attempting to create a difficult Artificial Intelligence.
No libraries will be used for the AI. I may implement something later on, but for now I want to have fun learning and tinkering.
